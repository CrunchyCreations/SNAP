    <h2>RICE KRISPIES: FROM CEREAL ICON</h2>
    <h3>Origins and Creation</h3>
        
<P>Rice Krispies were introduced by Kellogg in 1928. The cereal was invented by food developers Mildred Day and Malitta Jensen, who discovered that puffed rice baked in the oven created a light, crisp texture that produced the now-famous "snap, crackle, pop" sound. The cereal was marketed as easy to digest, simple, and fun—appealing to children and adults alike.</P>

<h3>How They Are Made</h3>
<P>Rice Krispies are made from milled rice, sugar, salt, and a bit of malt flavor, but the key is in the cooking process. The rice grains are cooked with sugar and vitamins, molded into small shapes, then toasted at high heat, causing them to expand ("puff") and form the airy, crispy texture. The popping sound occurs because the grains have tiny air pockets that collapse when milk softens them.</P>

<H3>Mascots: Snap, Crackle, and Pop</H3>
<P>Their mascots debuted in the early 1930s and became one of Kellogg’s most memorable advertising successes. Each character was designed to represent a different sound the cereal makes. Over the years, they’ve undergone multiple redesigns but have always remained small, elf-like characters. Less known is that in some early versions, there were additional siblings—like "Pow," representing the cereal’s nutritional punch—but these didn’t stick around.</P>

<H3>Rice Krispies Treats</H3>
<P>One of the biggest cultural impacts of the cereal came from Rice Krispies Treats, invented in 1939 by Mildred Day for a Girl Scouts fundraiser. The recipe—melting butter and marshmallows, then mixing in Rice Krispies—became a classic, especially in American households. Kellogg later commercialized the treat in ready-made bar form in the 1990s.</P>

<H3>International Versions</H3>
<P>The cereal is sold worldwide, sometimes under different formulations or names:</P>
<P>In the UK and Australia, Rice Krispies are often sold under the name Rice Bubbles, while in other countries the cereal is adapted with local sweeteners or specific vitamin-fortification blends to suit regional tastes and regulations. In Japan, similar puffed-rice cereals existed independently long before Kellogg expanded into the market, making the product familiar to consumers even before the official brand arrived.</P>

<H3>Nutritional Profile and Changes Over Time</H3>
<P>Over the decades, Kellogg has modified the cereal’s formula to meet nutrition standards—including reducing sugar and adding vitamins and minerals. While still marketed primarily to kids, Rice Krispies remain one of the simplest and lowest-sugar cereals in Kellogg’s lineup.</P>

<H3>Pop Culture and Media</H3>
<P>Rice Krispies have become a recognizable part of pop culture, appearing in a wide range of media over the decades. The cereal was especially prominent in television commercials from the 1950s through the 1980s, many of which featured catchy jingles that helped cement its place in American households. Beyond TV, Rice Krispies have been featured in magazine comics and have inspired collectible merchandise centered around their iconic mascots. They’ve also been frequently parodied in cartoons and comedy shows, reflecting their long-standing cultural presence. Additionally, the cereal plays a popular role in holiday traditions, particularly through creative Rice Krispies Treats shaped into festive trees, ornaments, and other seasonal designs.</P> 

<H3>Fun Facts</H3>
<p>Rice Krispies have accumulated a number of fun and quirky facts throughout their history. Early marketing famously promoted the cereal as a food that “talks back” because of the distinctive snapping, crackling, and popping sounds it makes when milk is added. Advertisements also emphasized its digestibility, which made the cereal a common choice in hospitals for patients needing mild, easy-to-eat foods. The mascots Snap, Crackle, and Pop even starred in their own radio show commercials that included full musical numbers, showcasing their popularity. And in a lesser-known bit of trivia, the trio briefly gained a fourth brother named Pow during the 1960s, though the character appeared only in limited advertisements and was quickly phased out.</p>
