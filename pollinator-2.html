   <h3>Founding and Early Origins (Late 1800s–1906)</h3>
    <p>     
        The Kellogg Company traces its roots to brothers Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and Will Keith Kellogg, who worked together at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan in the late 19th century. While experimenting with ways to create healthy, easily digestible foods for patients, the brothers accidentally discovered a flaked-grain process that led to the creation of the first cornflakes. Will Kellogg recognized the commercial potential of the product and in 1906 founded the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which later became the Kellogg Company. His focus on mass production, branding, and nationwide distribution helped turn cornflakes into a household staple.</p>
<H3>Expansion and Innovation (1910s–1940s)</H3>
<P>During the early 20th century, Kellogg expanded quickly by introducing new cereals, adopting modern advertising techniques, and emphasizing nutrition. The company became known for its bold marketing strategies, such as using colorful cartoon characters and offering free prizes in cereal boxes. By the 1930s and 1940s, Kellogg had become one of the most recognizable food brands in America. During World War II, the company supported the war effort while continuing to develop new products, including Rice Krispies, which later gained its iconic mascots Snap, Crackle, and Pop.</P>    
<H3>Global Growth and Brand Development (1950s–1980s)</H3>
<P>After World War II, Kellogg expanded internationally, establishing production facilities in Europe, Latin America, and Australia. The company broadened its product line beyond breakfast cereals, adding convenience foods, snacks, and health-focused items. Advertising became even more central to Kellogg’s identity during the television era, with memorable mascots like Tony the Tiger, Toucan Sam, and the Rice Krispies trio playing major roles in brand recognition. By the 1980s, Kellogg had become a global leader in packaged foods.</P>
<H3>Diversification and Modern Transformation (1990s–2010s)</H3>
<P>During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Kellogg continued diversifying through acquisitions and innovations. It purchased brands such as Keebler, Pringles, and MorningStar Farms, expanding into snacks, vegetarian foods, and international markets. The company also modernized its manufacturing and advertising, adapting to evolving consumer tastes, including growing interest in whole grains, organic options, and on-the-go products.</P>
<H3>Recent Developments and Restructuring (2020s–Present)</H3>
<P>In the 2020s, Kellogg entered a new phase of strategic restructuring to adapt to competitive global food markets. The company announced significant organizational changes, including separating its cereal business from its snacking and convenience-foods division to create more focused, agile brands. Despite shifts in consumer habits and increased competition, Kellogg remains a major force in the global food industry, known for its enduring brands, innovation, and cultural impact spanning more than a century.</P>
