    <h2>THE ORIGINS OF SNAP! CRACKLE! POP!</h2>

    <P></P>
        
    <H3> THE START (1930S)</H3>
    <p>
        The origins of Snap, Crackle, and Pop date to the early 1930s. In 1932, writer Grant Wood coined the phrase “Snap! Crackle! Pop!” to describe the distinctive sounds Rice Krispies make when milk is poured over them. A year later, in 1933, illustrator Vernon Grant brought these sounds to life by creating three gnome-like characters—Snap with his baker’s hat, Crackle with his striped stocking cap, and Pop with his drum major hat. These mascots first appeared in print advertisements and quickly became central to the cereal’s identity.
        </p>
        <H3>RADIO AND EARLY MARKETING</H3>
    <p>
        Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Snap, Crackle, and Pop became familiar voices on radio programs, appearing in jingles that helped Rice Krispies gain national recognition. Their names emphasized the cereal’s playful auditory appeal—the three unique sounds heard when milk is added. Early marketing focused heavily on this sensory experience, making the mascots natural ambassadors for the brand.</p>
    </P>
    <H3>TELEVISION ERA (1950s–1970s)</H3>
        <p>
        With the rise of television in the 1950s, the trio transitioned into animated commercials. Early TV portrayals kept the characters small and elf-like, often engaging in lighthearted antics. Through the 1960s and 1970s, their designs evolved to become softer and more stylized, aligning with contemporary animation trends. During this era, their character roles were also solidified: Snap as the leader, Crackle as the cheerful and clever middle figure, and Pop as the energetic youngest member.
        </p>
        <H3>MODERN EVOLUTION (1980s–Present)</H3>
        <P>From the 1980s onward, Snap, Crackle, and Pop continued to evolve alongside shifting marketing and animation styles. They were redesigned several times, including a move into 3D computer animation in the late 1990s and 2000s. The characters also appeared in numerous international advertising campaigns and special promotional variations. Despite these visual changes, their core personalities and appeal have remained consistent.</P>
        <H3>CULTURAL IMPACT</H3>
        <p>Snap, Crackle, and Pop have become some of the longest-lasting cereal mascots still in use today. Their sound-inspired names have entered popular culture as a recognizable catchphrase. Over the decades, they have appeared not only in commercials but also in comics, merchandise, and various media parodies. Their longevity and adaptability have cemented them as enduring icons of breakfast advertising.</p>
